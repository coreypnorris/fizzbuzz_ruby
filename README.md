##Fizzbuzz

####This is a ruby method for solving [fizzbuzz]()

To use it just copy the code from the lib/fizzbuzz.rb file and paste it into a ruby client ([Here's a link](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/installing-ruby) that helped me install ruby on my machine). Then type 'fizzbuzz(your-number-here)' in the client.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/fizzbuzz-title-case-allergies-psychology-test) was meant to introduce us to writing our own ruby methods.
